UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:   
    1. I would like to add a "surprise me" button. Let's say you don't know exactly what you want to cook that day, you can click that button to get a recipe picked at random. 
    2. A notes section to jot down whatever comes to mind before, after, or while prepapring the meal preparing the meal.
    3. A timer to keep track of start and end times for steps of the recipe that require a certain amount of prep time.
