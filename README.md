Problem: During the pandemic of COVID-19, I've been finding it hard to come up with creative, yet healthy recipes. I've cooked more now than I've ever done before and it was becoming difficult to look forward to eating the same meals over and over again. I created this application to be able to quickly find recipes based on the ingredients that I have in my pantry. Because I am bad at keeping track of the ingredients I do have and the ones that I need to purchase, I also created a shopping list aspect. The shopping list itemizes all ingredients so you can go through and mark/unmark what I need to purchase.


UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:   
    1. I would like to add a "surprise me" button. Let's say you don't know exactly what you want to cook that day, you can click that button to get a recipe picked at random. 
    2. A notes section to jot down whatever comes to mind before, after, or while prepapring the meal preparing the meal.
    3. A timer to keep track of start and end times for steps of the recipe that require a certain amount of prep time.
